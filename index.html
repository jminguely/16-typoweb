          Neco is a family of serif fonts, designed for use in headlines as 
          well as smaller-sized texts of short and medium length. The fonts’ 
          serifs have been designed with chunky, prominent wedge-shaped forms. 
          The letterforms feature a diagonal axis of stress. As a family, Neco 
          includes four weights, ranging from Regular through Black. Each weight 
          has an upright and an italic font on offer. Neco’s letterforms have a 
          high amount of stroke contrast, and the degree of contrast really 
          increases from weight to weight. The Black and Black Italic fonts are 
          particularly dynamic, in terms of their appearance. Neco’s lowercase 
          letters have a tall x-height, and their ascenders rise up above the 
          height of the fonts’ capitals. The letterforms in the Italic fonts are 
          not oblique versions of the upright’s glyphs, but true cursive forms. 
          The default numeral style in each font is proportional oldstyle 
          figures, but tabular figures, lining figures, small cap figures, as 
          well as a full range of numerators and denominators for typesetting 
          fractions are in the character set as well. There are also several 
          f-ligatures, substituted into the text by the fonts’ OpenType 
          features. Neco is an excellent choice for use in editorial design, or 
          for typesetting invitations and event-graphics. The fonts were 
          designed by Jitka Janečková.
